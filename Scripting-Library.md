### Notes:
- "Method" and "function" are used as as synonymous in all pages.
- The ellipsis, `...`, represents a variable number of arguments, usually used when extra parameters are supported by the function.
- Parameters surrounded by square brackets `[ ]` are optional parameters.
- A vertical bar `|` represents different possible types (for variables, arguments or return types).
- Commas in return types indicate that the function has more than 1 return value.
