(function op) is used by some monsters do something else in addition to using an Xyz Material (e.g. Digital Bug Corebage (detach 2 materials) or Number 99: Utopic Dragon (discard 1 "Rank-Up-Magic")). (bool mustbemat) is used if you can only use the listed materials during the Xyz Summon, this disallows Anime effects such as Orichalcum Chain (minus 1 material) or Triangle Evolution (triple material).
